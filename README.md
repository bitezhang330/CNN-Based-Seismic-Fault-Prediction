# CNN_based_Seismic_Fault_Prediction
Using synthetic seismic data

**Author**: [Suman Gautam](mailto:smngeo@gmail.com)

## Overview

This is an ongoing project on building a deep learning learning models to accurately detect fault from seismic images. 


## Data

The synthetic data were taken from FORCE competition provided by XEEK.ai To get more information follow the link below:
(https://xeek.ai/challenges/force-seismic/overview)


## Content

The introductory data exploration will be provided in a separate notebook while the machine learning models will be provided under each type of the machine learning framework name.
The current model uses a simple UNet framework. 
Future studies will be continued to improve the network and also to implement GAN based frameworks.



## For More Information

See the UNet model in the [Jupyter Notebook](./Pytorch_based_UNet_Model.ipynb)
